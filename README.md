# Logistics_Spend_Dashboard

**Project Domain**: Logistics

**Tools used**: Power BI, Power Query, SQL, MS Excel, SAP BW

**Project details (General)**: Between May 2019 and May 2021 I worked as a Logistics Chieff in Agro-Industrial multinational company (a US company with offices in Argentina). In this position, I developed this Logistics Spend Dashboard. Having this tool, provided us with the following benefits:
  - In the context of a scenario with very high inflation (53% in 2019, 36% in 2020 and around 51% in 2021), we had a source of fresh data that allowed us to negotiate better tariff increases with our suppliers. 
  - We were able to compare actual freight prices for customers in the same region and act accordingly.
  - We could easily spot inefficiencies and create plans to reduce them.
  - We were able to optimize routes, based on the cost to serve from each of our plants.

**Project details (Details)**: 
  - In order to pull the data to create this Dashboard, I connected Power BI directly to SAP BW, SQL servers and Excel files.
  - The data was later worked in Power Query.
  - Many measures and columns were added later using DAX language.
  
**Programming Languages**: SQL, DAX, M.

**Project Participation**: I worked independently on this project

**Confidentiality**: For reasons of confidentiality, the Dashboard can not be shared here (previews are provided below). For the same reasons, client names are not shown.
